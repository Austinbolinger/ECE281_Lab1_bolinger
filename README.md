#Analysis
The Truth Table created was created by using 2's Complement to find the output.

The testbench was coded to test the logic gate designs from the K-maps.

The testbench output matched the Truth Table line by line. Each output matched my truth table.

####Test
three bit was tested in class

#####Documentation
**C3C Hayden - Helped with how to handle a K-map with an isolated 1 or 0**

**C3C Pluger - we checked our answers and logic together**
